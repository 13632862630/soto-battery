<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt was just 6 years before that Apple re-invented the Tablet PC, but it is unexpected, cruel sales data show that the Tablet PC has become a sunset industry, to face the continuous contraction, some manufacturers have begun to adjust, such as Asus is expected to exit the Tablet PC business in the first half of next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In November, authoritative technology market research firm IDC released the third quarter of the Tablet PC market report, which shows flat panel market has declined for eighth consecutive quarter. In the third quarter, global shipments amout is just 43 million units, which has down 14.7% (if Planing to get rid of Surface Pro and other mixed flat, flat-panel decline even greater)</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJust appeared a few years, why Tablet PC soon become a sunset industry? A media analysis pointed out, smart phones became with large-screen , ultra-thin ultra-thin notebook became ultra-thin, and smart TV (network set-top box) can display online videos and other factors caused this situation. Big-screen mobile phone shows more competitiveness in portability, and screen viewing experience, makes it eroded the Tablet PC market. In addition, in high-efficiency commercial office and other fields, it was found that Tablet PC is still could not replace the traditional notebook computers, and notebook became ultra-portable, offset the Tablet PC has a major advantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAccording to the Taiwan Electronic Times website reported, on the first half of 2016, once the world's leading Tablet PC manufacturers Asustek, began restructuring of the Tablet PC business, including a large-scale reduction of Tablet PC development projects and reduce shipments target.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt present, Asus Tablet PC business still has hundreds of employees engaged in the development and sale of flat. Asustek is poised to shift the remainder to other emerging businesses, such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and the smartphone business that Asustek is focusing on. The rest of the restructuring plan is expected to be completed in the first half of next year.</p>
